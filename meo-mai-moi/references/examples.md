# Install and Example Prompts

## Install in OpenClaw

Put the skill folder in one of these locations:

- `<workspace>/skills/meo-mai-moi/`
- `<workspace>/.agents/skills/meo-mai-moi/`
- `~/.openclaw/skills/meo-mai-moi/`

Minimal layout:

```text
meo-mai-moi/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    ├── api.md
    ├── domain-model.md
    ├── examples.md
    └── workflows.md
```

After installing, start a new session or restart the gateway so OpenClaw reloads skills.

Useful checks:

```bash
openclaw skills list
openclaw agent --message "List my Meo Mai Moi pets"
```

## Connect your agent with an API key

To use Meo Mai Moi through an agent, sign in to Meo Mai Moi, create a personal API key/token, and provide that key to your agent securely.

Recommended setup: store the Meo Mai Moi API key in a local env file outside git.

Example:

```env
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

The agent should load it from a local env file or secret manager and never commit it, log it, paste it into public chats, or echo it back unless the user explicitly asks to reveal it.

Without this key, the agent can understand the skill documentation but cannot access the user's Meo Mai Moi pets or account data.

## Example user prompts

These are good natural-language triggers for the skill:

- "List my pets from Meo Mai Moi."
- "Show me the current profile for Miu on Meo Mai Moi."
- "Add a new weight entry for Bánh Bao: 4.3kg today." (Agent should call the live API with `weight_kg` and `record_date`.)
- "Update this pet's description but keep everything else unchanged."
- "Check whether my Meo Mai Moi API key still works."
- "Explain what helper profiles are on Meo Mai Moi."
- "Help me understand whether this placement request is active or pending transfer."
- "Use Meo Mai Moi to add a vaccination record for my cat."

## Example agent behavior

Good behavior:

- Read current state first.
- Use documented routes.
- Match payload field names to the verified live contract, especially for nested health records.
- Confirm destructive actions.
- Re-read after writes.
- Explain state transitions for placement tasks.

Bad behavior:

- Invent undocumented endpoints.
- Use `PATCH` for pet updates without proof.
- Delete or transfer ownership casually.
- Expose PAT secrets in logs, chat, or commits.

## Suggested one-line setup note for users

"Use the Meo Mai Moi skill whenever I ask you to manage my pets, health records, helper profiles, or placement workflows through the documented API. Load my local API token from env, use read-first workflows, and avoid undocumented routes."
